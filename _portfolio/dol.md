My work with the Department of Labor as a usability research and prototyping consultant for a large-scale website redesign led by <a href="http://rayogram.com">rayogram</a>, a creative agency based in TriBeCa.

This consulting work consisted of an in-depth usability study examining the audience of the DoL website based current website analytics, task completion metrics, and user surveys. I was also brought in to help build out the tablet and mobile prototypes using Adobe XD as a collaboration with the design team at rayogram.
