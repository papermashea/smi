Parsons' <a href="https://cpe.newschool.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&certificateId=1408175" target="_blank">Futures Studies and Speculative Design Certification</a> explores strategies for navigating the complex questions individuals, communities, governments, and businesses all face when making plans for the future. The coursework explores the application of sensory experiences to futures studies theory and methods to develop projections of scenarios and examine ways futures discourse can shape a projectâ€™s or company's path forward.

My work in this program explores the future of digital creative content and how it relates to <strong>creativity, class, and commerce</strong>. I conducted signals research and modeling exercises by creating a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdwcwDAZ4-BePWBC6UmIBqQJqSQxYusqDG-DzpymOj3KT5vsA/viewform" target="_blank">signals collection form</a> through which I could collect ongoing industry news over the course of 60 days, organizing signals with the STEEP model:

<ul>
	<li>Social</li>
	<li>Technological</li>
	<li>Economic</li>
	<li>Economic</li>
	<li>Political</li>
</ul> 

I collected more than 100 signals across the digital content landscape including news from film, music, video, photography, illustration, 3D, XR segments. The data collected largely pertained to content platforms such as Youtube, Tiktok, Facebook, Twitch, Reddit, Netflix, Spotify, HBO, Hulu, and Steam, but also collected signals regarding payment platforms, technology companies, legal groups, and decentralized spaces.

I collected further data on emotional responses to these events, as well as which aspects of the digital content industry they affect and which people were affected by them. I organized these variables of influence with the following model:

<table class="col three">
	<tr>
		<th class="col one">People</th>
		<th class="col one">Processes</th>
		<th class="col one">Emotions</th>
	</tr>
	<tr class="img_row">
		<td class="col one">
			<ul>
				<li>Creators</li>
				<li>Consumers</li>
				<li>Workers</li>
				<li>Investors</li>
				<li>Companies</li>
			</ul> 
		</td>
		<td class="col one">
			<ul>
				<li>Creation</li>
				<li>Possession</li>
				<li>Compensation</li>
				<li>Distribution</li>
				<li>Regulation</li>
			</ul> 
		</td>
		<td class="col one">
			<ul>
				<li>Excited</li>
				<li>Content</li>
				<li>Mind-blown</li>
				<li>Curious</li>
				<li>Unsurprised</li>
				<li>Sad</li>
				<li>Distraught</li>

After synthesizing all of this information, I developed a futures matrix exploring 4 possible narratives relating the cost of goods and the cost of creative. From there, I further developed a series of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/img/work/futures-studies/Molloy_Futures-narratives.pdf" target="_blank">narrative scenarios</a> which detailed the human experience of how these scenarios could play out.

This speculative deisgn process led to the development of a conceptual, interactive data mapping game, in which everyone could democratically participate in the collection and tagging of content creation signals. Since this industry affects almost everyone, the most immersive element to this project was exploring how the research itself could make everyone a consumer, and everyone a creator.

<br>
Partipants submitting, ideating and exploring the data themselves was designed to aggregate algorithmically recommended signals as well as emotional responses to this continuously evolving landscape.
