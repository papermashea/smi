As a member of Parsons' <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/ms-data-visualization/" target="_blank">Master of Science in Data Visualization (MSDV)</a> program, I was asked to help support the following classes and workshops for Art, Media, and Technology students:

<ul>
	<li>Coding with the machine Stable Diffusion intensive</li>
	<li>GAN & Data visualization intensive</li>
	<li>Data as Material semester-long class</li>
	<li>Emerging Technology module</li>
</ul>

As a teaching assistant, I developed Python, Javascript, and Github workshops for machine learning and creative data projects. I worked one-on-one with students to improve their data structures, troubleshoot git, python and javascript workflows, and create material for their projects from video, photo, ad-hoc data sources.

I was also asked to act as a Program Assistant during the Summer of 2021, which involved cleaning up the <a href="https://parsons.nyc/" target="_blank">Parsons MSDV student thesis repo data</a> in addition to troubleshooting new features such as video playback and design implementation in Vue.JS
